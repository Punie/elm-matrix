# Elm Matrix [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Punie/elm-matrix.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Punie/elm-matrix)

Implementation of a Matrix type using flat arrays for speed.

The goal is to build a complete linear algebra library in pure elm.

This library provides the `Matrix a` type along with some convenience functions for building, manipulating and pretty printing matrices.
